The Window Object
-	Is supported in all browsers
-	Represents the browsers window 
-	All global JS amenities become part of the window object
-	You can adjust the windows height and width by modifying the window object 
-	When you want to edit the window in Internet Explorer (for all the snowbirds) you use the documentElement.client(height or width)
-	You can also use some of the built in functions such as moveTo(), Open(), print(), Prompt() and each of these do kind of self-explanatory things.  
-	You can use the prompt() function for alerts, var alertTag = prompt(message), coupled with an alert() function alter(“message” + alertTag)
-	You can also have this extra window called a child window, this is used often for advertisements and logging in with Facebook kind of stuff.  
APIs 
-	In short APIs and the bomb digity.com! 
-	They allow to access treasure troves of information for your application without having to gather, write, or save it yourself! Things like google maps, Bluetooth, encryption extensions. For any information like that there is most likely an API out there for that. 
-	Most api’s are set up in object or array notation. Making accessing and parsing the information fairly straight forward.  
o	Question how difficult is it to make an API? 
o	Do you need to have special qualifications or accreditations to make your API world ready? 
o	Could we make an API with the skills that we have learned in this class?
-	   There are also HTML5 specific API’s that help to manipulate a certain genre of data like the media API, the drag and drop API, and things that make web development easier.
